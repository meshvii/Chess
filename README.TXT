HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
AUTHORS:
USER INSTRUCTIONS:

Phase 0: I have ignored every file except for .java and .txt files for my git repository.

Phase 1: I have created created six new classes named Pawn,Castle,Knight, Bishop, Queen and King. These classes 
         contain two constructors for intializing the members. They are also subclasses of ChessPiece.
         I have also uncommented resetBoard inside Board Class.

Phase 2: I have created BoardLoader Class. This class contains four methods that will read from the file and assign it 
         board and create new ChessPiece instance.

Phase 3. I have created a new method in every six class and isValidMove which is responsible for all the moves throughout the game
         I could not complete the jump code completely.
         But I have commented one isValidMove inside Castle Class that works for blocking the pieces but cannot capture opponent's piece
         which is the part I couldn't do. I have also commented entire method for your clarification.
